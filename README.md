# Codeunit Inheritance

This app shows a "faux" way of inheriting codeunits. It has a base "class" codeunit of "Person" which can be inherited by two derived "class" codeunits of Couch Potato and Athlete.
In the derived classes you can both get _and set_ the base class properties, since the codeunit instance is apparently persistent.

Try it out!
